# College Compass

## Introduction
College Compass is a data visualization project that aims to provide users with insights into higher education statistics in the United States. With data provided by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), College Compass provides visualizations and interactive tools for users to explore trends and patterns in enrollment rates, completion rates, demographics, and more.

## Problem Statement
Higher education is becoming increasingly important in today's job market, but navigating the complexities of college enrollment and completion can be challenging for students, parents, and educators alike. College Compass seeks to provide a user-friendly and informative tool for exploring higher education data in order to inform decision-making and support student success.

## Resources
The College Compass project utilizes a range of tools and technologies to process and visualize the NCES data. The front-end of the project is built using the Angular framework, with additional libraries including D3.js and Material Design. The back-end is built using Flask, a Python-based web framework, with a PostgreSQL database for storing and querying the NCES data.

## Development Steps
The College Compass project was developed in a series of stages, with each stage building on the previous one to create a comprehensive and interactive data visualization tool. The key steps in the development process are outlined below:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Data preprocessing: downloading the NCES dataset and cleaning and transforming the data to make it usable for analysis and visualization |
| 2     | Database setup: creating a PostgreSQL database and importing the transformed NCES data |
| 3     | Back-end development: building Flask APIs to serve the NCES data to the front-end |
| 4     | Front-end development: creating an Angular app with interactive visualizations and user-friendly tools for exploring the NCES data |
| 5     | Testing and deployment: testing the app for usability and functionality and deploying the app to a live server for public access |

## How to Use
To use College Compass, simply navigate to the live website and explore the various visualizations and interactive tools available. Users can filter and sort data by a range of variables, such as state, institution type, and demographics, to explore trends and patterns in higher education statistics.

## Conclusion
College Compass is an important tool for anyone interested in higher education statistics, whether as a student, educator, or policy maker. By providing accessible and informative data visualizations, College Compass helps users make informed decisions about college enrollment and completion, and supports efforts to improve educational outcomes for all.
